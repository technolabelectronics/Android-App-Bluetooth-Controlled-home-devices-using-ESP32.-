# Introduction
Now we can control our home appliances through our smartphone using Bluetooth feature of ESP32. and apart from this we can also control devices  from manual switch buttons that we conventionally do.
For making of this home-automation system , I will use my 2 node SMT home-automation PCB and custom design android app.

Best part of this project is that we don't need any internet connection or any local server to connect android application to  ESP32.
Most of people don't have WIFI connection, so this home-automation system is for them. 
 
Here App will directly communicate to the ESP32 via Bluetooth,
Using Bluetooth is very convenient way of making home-automation system for local range and also this is the only downside of this project.
